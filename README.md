# Mark it Off

Mark it Off is a time sensitive task list where Users will be able to create a to-do list, and each task will automatically be  oraganized from newest to oldest. The tasks will then turn from green to red over the course of seven days, and after seventh day, it will then be marked as failed, and deleated.

## Where is the site?

Mark it Off was originally hosted on Heroku, but after some time, errors occured, and Heroku will no longer support Mark it Off due to some version issues. I will work on figuring out exactly what the issue it, and solve it, but for now, I am in the works on a much larger project.

### Site Navigation

The first thing you will notice is the design! It portrays a very early Linux/Windows look.

Mark it Off displays each task using a well organzied "centered-vertical" flex-box style, along with nice animations to accompany the creation and deletion of each task. 

On your first log on, you will be welcomed with a quick tutorial bubble to teach you what to do to get started, just type in the box to create your first task and begin!

When a task is successfully created, a notice bubble will appear to confirm the completion.
